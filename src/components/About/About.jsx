            customer-centric company, Earth’s best employer, and Earth’s safest
            place to work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized
            recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by MegaCart, MegaCart Studios,
            and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by MegaCart.
